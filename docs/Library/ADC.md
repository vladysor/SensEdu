# ADC Peripheral
{: .fs-8 .fw-500 .no_toc}
---

Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) translate analog signals (e.g., from sensors or microphones) into digital form, readable by CPU. 
{: .fw-500}

The STM32H747 features three 16-bit ADCs with up to 20 multiplexed channels each.

## Errors

The main ADC error code prefix is `0x20xx`. Find the way to display errors in your Arduino sketch [here]({% link Library/index.md %}#error-handling).

An overview of possible errors for ADC:

* `0x2000`: No Errors
* `0x2001`: ADC was initialized before initialization
* `0x2002`: Passed ADC instance is not either `ADC1`, `ADC2` nor `ADC3`
* `0x2003`: ADC failed to disable
* `0x2004`: ADC failed to power up
* `0x2005`: Selected pin for ADC is not reachable. Refer to the [table] to find proper pins for each ADC instance
* `0x2006`: Unexpected pin number during initialization. Must be at least 1
* `0x2007`: Unexpected address or memory size for DMA
* `0x2008`: Unexpected sampling frequency. Must be at least 1kHz
* `0x2009`: Software polling in `SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_ONE_SHOT` is currently broken. Use `SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_CONT` or `SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_CONT_TIM_TRIGGERED`. If you want to look into this and have a try fixing it, refer to [this issue]

An overview of critical errors. They shouldn't happen in normal user case and indicate some problems in library code:

* `0x20A0`: PLL configuration failed
* `0x20A1`: Internal logic for channel selection failed
* `0x20A1`: Internal logic for setting sample time failed
* `0x20A2`: Operation mode selection accepted unexpected value. Should never happen, since all possible values of type `SENSEDU_ADC_CONVMODE` must be handled internally
* `0x20A3`: Data management mode selection accepted unexpected value. Should never happen, since all possible values of type `SENSEDU_ADC_DMA` must be handled internally

#### Notes {#adc_mapping}
{: .no_toc}

Be aware of which pins you can use with selected ADC. Table below shows ADC connections. For example, you can't access `ADC3` with pin `A7`, cause it is only connected to `ADC1`. 

* `ADCx_INPy`:
  * `x`: Connected ADCs (e.g., `ADC12_INP4` - `ADC1` and `ADC2`)
  * `y`: Channel index

## Functions

### SensEdu_ADC_Init
Configures ADC clock and initializes peripheral with specified settings (channels, sampling frequency, etc.).

```c
void SensEdu_ADC_Init(SensEdu_ADC_Settings* adc_settings);
```

{: .no_toc}
* Initializes associated DMA and timer in `SENSEDU_ADC_DMA_CONNECT` and `SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_CONT_TIM_TRIGGERED` modes respectively.

{: .WARNING}
Be careful to initialize each required ADC before enabling. Certain configuration is shared between multiple ADCs, which could be edited only if related ADCs are disabled.

```c
// ERROR
SensEdu_ADC_Init(ADC1_Settings);
SensEdu_ADC_Enable(ADC1);
SensEdu_ADC_Init(ADC2_Settings);
SensEdu_ADC_Enable(ADC2);

// CORRECT
SensEdu_ADC_Init(ADC1_Settings);
SensEdu_ADC_Init(ADC2_Settings);
SensEdu_ADC_Enable(ADC1);
SensEdu_ADC_Enable(ADC2);
```


### SensEdu_ADC_Enable
Powers on the ADC.

```c
void SensEdu_ADC_Enable(ADC_TypeDef* ADC);

### SensEdu_ADC_Disable
Deactivates the ADC.

```c
void SensEdu_ADC_Disable(ADC_TypeDef* ADC);
```

#### Parameters
{: .no_toc}
* `ADC`: ADC Instance (`ADC1`, `ADC2` or `ADC3`)

### SensEdu_ADC_Start
Triggers ADC conversions.

```c
void SensEdu_ADC_Start(ADC_TypeDef* ADC);
```

#### Parameters
{: .no_toc}
* `ADC`: ADC Instance (`ADC1`, `ADC2` or `ADC3`)

#### Notes
{: .no_toc}
* Enables associated DMA in `SENSEDU_ADC_DMA_CONNECT` mode.


### SensEdu_ADC_GetTransferStatus

uint8_t SensEdu_ADC_GetTransferStatus(ADC_TypeDef* adc);
```

#### Parameters
{: .no_toc}
* `ADC`: ADC Instance (`ADC1`, `ADC2` or `ADC3`)

#### Returns
{: .no_toc}
* `dma_complete` flag: `HIGH` indicated that DMA controller finished memory transfer

#### Notes
{: .no_toc}
* `dma_complete` flag is automatically cleared by calling `SensEdu_ADC_Start()`

{: .TIP}
Avoid performing any actions without acknowledging this flag. It ensures that the data was completely transferred.


### SensEdu_ADC_ReadConversion
Manually read a single ADC conversion (alternative to DMA).

```c
uint16_t SensEdu_ADC_ReadConversion(ADC_TypeDef* ADC)
```

#### Parameters
{: .no_toc}
* `ADC`: ADC Instance (`ADC1`, `ADC2` or `ADC3`)

#### Returns
{: .no_toc}
* 16-bit value from selected channel

#### Notes
{: .no_toc}
* Used for readings using single channel. For multi-channel readings, use `SensEdu_ADC_ReadSequence`.
* Consumes CPU cycles. Prefer DMA to free CPU for other tasks. For example, you can perform complex calculations on ADC values, while requesting the new set of data with DMA.
* Refer to non-DMA examples like `Read_ADC_1CH`.


### SensEdu_ADC_ReadSequence
Manually read a sequence of ADC conversions (alternative to DMA).

```c
uint16_t SensEdu_ADC_ReadSequence(ADC_TypeDef* ADC)
```

#### Parameters
{: .no_toc}
* `ADC`: ADC Instance (`ADC1`, `ADC2` or `ADC3`)

#### Returns
{: .no_toc}
* A pointer to an array of ADC conversion results. Index the array to access values: `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, etc., corresponding to the amount of selected channels (`pins` array in `SensEdu_ADC_Settings`)

#### Notes
{: .no_toc}
* Used for readings using multiple channels. For single-channel readings, use `SensEdu_ADC_ReadConversion`.
* Consumes CPU cycles. Prefer DMA to free CPU for other tasks. For example, you can perform complex calculations on ADC values, while requesting the new set of data with DMA.
* Refer to non-DMA examples like `Read_ADC_3CH`.

{: .WARNING}
Multi-channel CPU polling currently doesn't work in `SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_ONE_SHOT`. Use `SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_CONT` or `SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_CONT_TIM_TRIGGERED`. If you want to look into this and have a try fixing it, refer to [this issue].


### SensEdu_ADC_ShortA4toA9
Shorts pin `A4` to `A9` on Arduino. 

```c
void SensEdu_ADC_ShortA4toA9(void);
```

#### Notes
{: .no_toc}
* **In older board revisions**, microphone #2 is wired to pin `A9` (`PC3_C`), which is routed only to `ADC3`. This conflicts with project requiring x4 microphones, using `ADC1` and `ADC2` with x2 channels per ADC. To solve this problem, `_C` pins could be shorted to their `non_C` counterparts. This way pin `A4` (`PC3`) is bridged to `A9` (`PC3_C`), allowing microphone #2 to be accessed via any ADC, since `PC3` is shared between `ADC1` and `ADC2`. Refer to the [table] at settings section for better understanding.


## Examples

Examples are organized incrementally. Each builds on the previous one by introducing only new features or modifications. Refer to earlier examples for core functionality details.
{: .fw-500}

If you want to see complete examples, visit `\examples\` directory or open them via Arduino IDE by navigating to `File → Examples → SensEdu`.

### Read_ADC_1CH

Continuously reads ADC conversions directly via CPU for one selected analog pin.

1. Include SensEdu library
2. Declare ADC instance, pin array and array size corresponding to your channel count for selected ADC
3. Configure ADC Parameters by declaring [`SensEdu_ADC_Settings`]({% link Library/ADC.md %}#sensedu_adc_settings) struct
4. Initialize `SensEdu_ADC_Init()` and power up ADC `SensEdu_ADC_Enable()`
5. Start ADC once with `SensEdu_ADC_Start()` (**once** applies only for continuous mode `SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_CONT`)
6. In a loop, manually read data from a single channel using `SensEdu_ADC_ReadConversion()`. Print results with `Serial`
7. Open Serial Monitor to see results. Try to connect selected pin to GND or 3.3V. The values should vary in a range from 0 to 65535

```c
#include "SensEdu.h"

ADC_TypeDef* adc = ADC1;
const uint8_t adc_pin_num = 1;
uint8_t adc_pins[adc_pin_num] = {A0};
SensEdu_ADC_Settings adc_settings = {
    .adc = adc,
    .pins = adc_pins,
    .pin_num = adc_pin_num,

    .conv_mode = SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_CONT,
    .sampling_freq = 0,
    
    .dma_mode = SENSEDU_ADC_DMA_DISCONNECT,
    .mem_address = 0x0000,
    .mem_size = 0
};

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    
    SensEdu_ADC_Init(&adc_settings);
    SensEdu_ADC_Enable(adc);
    SensEdu_ADC_Start(adc);
}

void loop() {
    uint16_t data = SensEdu_ADC_ReadConversion(adc);
    Serial.println(data);
}
```

#### Notes
{: .no_toc}
* For the most simple CPU polling configuration there are unused parameters like `.sampling_rate` or `.mem_address`. Such parameters could be set to any value, they are completely ignored.
* ADC values are 16-bit, vary from 0 (0V) to 65535 (3.3V).


### Read_ADC_3CH

Continuously reads sequences of ADC conversions directly via CPU for multiple selected analog pins.

1. Follow base configuration from the [`Read_ADC_1CH`]({% link Library/ADC.md %}#read_adc_1ch) example
2. Expand pin array to include all desired channels. Update array size to match channel count
3. Use `SensEdu_ADC_ReadSequence()` to retrieve a channel sequence array

```c
...
const uint8_t adc_pin_num = 3;
uint8_t adc_pins[adc_pin_num] = {A0, A1, A2};
...
void loop() {
    uint16_t* data = SensEdu_ADC_ReadSequence(adc);
    Serial.println("-------");
    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < adc_pin_num; i++) {
        Serial.print("Value CH");
        Serial.print(i);
        Serial.print(": ");
        Serial.println(data[i]);
    }
}
```

#### Notes
{: .no_toc}
* Compared to single-channel configuration, `SensEdu_ADC_ReadSequence()` returns not a value, but a pointer. Using this pointer, you can access all channels in a sequence with index brackets `[]`.
* ADC conversions are organized in a "package" called **sequence**. They follow exact order defined in `adc_pins` (A0 → A1 → A2 in this example).


### Read_ADC_1CH_TIM

Continuously reads ADC conversions directly via CPU for one selected analog pin with constant sampling rate using timer trigger.

1. Follow base configuration from the [`Read_ADC_1CH`]({% link Library/ADC.md %}#read_adc_1ch) example
2. Update conversion mode `.conv_mode` in `SensEdu_ADC_Settings` to `SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_CONT_TIM_TRIGGERED`
3. Specify sampling frequency in Hz via `.sampling_freq`

```c
...
SensEdu_ADC_Settings adc_settings = {
    .adc = adc,
    .pins = adc_pins,
    .pin_num = adc_pin_num,

    .conv_mode = SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_CONT_TIM_TRIGGERED,
    .sampling_freq = 250000,
    
    .dma_mode = SENSEDU_ADC_DMA_DISCONNECT,
    .mem_address = 0x0000,
    .mem_size = 0
};
...
```

#### Notes
{: .no_toc}
* Expect small variations from specified sampling frequency


### Read_ADC_3CH_TIM

Continuously reads sequences of ADC conversions directly via CPU for multiple selected analog pins with constant sampling rate using timer trigger.

1. Follow base multi-channel configuration from the [`Read_ADC_3CH`]({% link Library/ADC.md %}#read_adc_3ch) example
2. Update conversion mode `.conv_mode` in `SensEdu_ADC_Settings` to `SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_CONT_TIM_TRIGGERED`
3. Specify sampling frequency in Hz via `.sampling_freq`

```c
...
SensEdu_ADC_Settings adc_settings = {
    .adc = adc,
    .pins = adc_pins,
    .pin_num = adc_pin_num,

    .conv_mode = SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_CONT_TIM_TRIGGERED,
    .sampling_freq = 250000,
    
    .dma_mode = SENSEDU_ADC_DMA_DISCONNECT,
    .mem_address = 0x0000,
    .mem_size = 0
};
...
```

#### Notes
{: .no_toc}
* Expect small variations from specified sampling frequency


### Read_ADC_1CH_DMA

Continuously reads ADC conversions using DMA for a single analog pin, allowing efficient data transfer without CPU intervention.

1. Follow the base configuration from the [`Read_ADC_1CH`]({% link Library/ADC.md %}#read_adc_1ch) example
2. Declare ADC Buffer with a macro `SENSEDU_ADC_BUFFER` to store the data. It takes two parameters: the user-defined ***name*** to be used in the code and the buffer ***size*** (number of elements)
3. In `SensEdu_ADC_Settings`, set `.dma_mode` to `SENSEDU_ADC_DMA_CONNECT`
4. Assign `.mem_address` to the buffer's first element address and `.mem_size` to its length
5. After calling `SensEdu_ADC_Start()`, the ADC fills the buffer with conversions and automatically stops, setting the `dma_complete` flag
6. Check `dma_complete` using `SensEdu_ADC_GetTransferStatus()`. When `true`, read the buffer and perform operations (e.g., print values, compute something)
7. Call `SensEdu_ADC_Start()` again to trigger the next ADC-DMA sequence

```c
#include "SensEdu.h"

const uint16_t memory4adc_size = 128;
SENSEDU_ADC_BUFFER(memory4adc, memory4adc_size);

ADC_TypeDef* adc = ADC1;
const uint8_t adc_pin_num = 1;
uint8_t adc_pins[adc_pin_num] = {A0};
SensEdu_ADC_Settings adc_settings = {
    .adc = adc,
    .pins = adc_pins,
    .pin_num = adc_pin_num,

    .conv_mode = SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_CONT,
    .sampling_freq = 0,
    
    .dma_mode = SENSEDU_ADC_DMA_CONNECT,
    .mem_address = (uint16_t*)memory4adc,
    .mem_size = memory4adc_size
};

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);

    SensEdu_ADC_Init(&adc_settings);
    SensEdu_ADC_Enable(adc);
    SensEdu_ADC_Start(adc);
}

void loop() {
    // do something else when transfer is not yet completed
    if (SensEdu_ADC_GetTransferStatus(adc)) {
        Serial.println("------");
        for (int i = 0; i < memory4adc_size; i++) {
            Serial.print("ADC value ");
            Serial.print(i);
            Serial.print(": ");
            Serial.println(memory4adc[i]);
        };

        SensEdu_ADC_Start(adc);
    }
}
```

#### Notes
{: .no_toc}
* `SensEdu_ADC_Start()` resets the `dma_complete` flag automatically.
* Optimize your code to use DMA capability to perform memory transfers in the background. For example, start a new measurement in the middle of calculations, when the whole old dataset is not needed anymore.

{: .WARNING}
Always use `SENSEDU_ADC_BUFFER` macro to define arrays for ADC in DMA mode. This macro automatically handles all buffer requirements for cache coherence, regardless of the selected size. For details, visit the [Cache Coherence]({% link Library/ADC.md %}#cache-coherence) section.


### Read_ADC_3CH_DMA

Continuously reads ADC conversions using DMA multiple selected analog pins, allowing efficient data transfer without CPU intervention.

1. Follow the DMA configuration from the [`Read_ADC_1CH_DMA`]({% link Library/ADC.md %}#read_adc_1ch_dma) example
2. Expand pin array to include all desired channels. Update array size to match channel count
3. Expand the ADC DMA buffer accordingly to include data for all channels
4. Data is organized in a sequence, following the order defined in pin array (e.g., A0 → A1 → A2 → A0 → A1 → ...)


```c
...
const uint8_t adc_pin_num = 3;
uint8_t adc_pins[adc_pin_num] = {A0, A1, A2}; 

const uint16_t memory4adc_size = 64 * adc_pin_num;
SENSEDU_ADC_BUFFER(memory4adc, memory4adc_size);
...
void loop() {
    // do something else when transfer is not yet completed
    if (SensEdu_ADC_GetTransferStatus(adc)) {
        Serial.println("------");
        for (int i = 0; i < memory4adc_size; i+=3) {
            Serial.print("ADC value ");
            Serial.print(i/3);
            Serial.print("CH1: ");
            Serial.println(memory4adc[i]);

            Serial.print("ADC value ");
            Serial.print(i/3);
            Serial.print("CH2: ");
            Serial.println(memory4adc[i+1]);

            Serial.print("ADC value ");
            Serial.print(i/3);
            Serial.print("CH3: ");
            Serial.println(memory4adc[i+2]);
        }

        SensEdu_ADC_Start(adc);
    };
}
```


### Read_2ADC_3CH_DMA

This example demonstrates the usage of multiple ADCs in DMA mode. Essentially, you follow the same steps as in the [`Read_ADC_3CH_DMA`]({% link Library/ADC.md %}#read_adc_3ch_dma) example, but use separate buffers, configuration structures, and function calls for each ADC.

For example:

```c
SensEdu_ADC_Init(&adc1_settings);
SensEdu_ADC_Enable(ADC1);
SensEdu_ADC_Start(ADC1);

SensEdu_ADC_Init(&adc2_settings);
SensEdu_ADC_Enable(ADC2);
SensEdu_ADC_Start(ADC2);
```

#### Notes
{: .no_toc}
* Ensure there is no pin overlap between different ADCs (e.g., do not include pin A0 in the arrays for both ADC1 and ADC2).


## Developer Notes

### DMA Streams

Each ADC occupies one DMA stream:
* **ADC1**: DMA1_Stream6
* **ADC2**: DMA1_Stream5
* **ADC3**: DMA1_Stream7

{: .WARNING }
Avoid reusing occupied DMA streams. Refer to [STM32H747 Reference Manual] to find free available streams.

### Reading ADC Data

The STM32H7 microcontroller is equipped with three ADC modules, each capable of accessing multiple channels (refer to the ADC mapping [table] above). Reading the ADC values from a single channel is straightforward, as the data is stored consecutively in an array. 

However, when reading data from multiple channels within a single ADC module, users must use different approach. The data for each channel is interleaved in the array, meaning that the data for each channel is stored one after the other, rather than all data from first channel followed by all data from second channel, and so forth. This structure is illustrated clearly in the following figure giving an example of using two channels with one ADC module. 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ADC_Data_Flow.png" alt="drawing"/>
{: .text-center}

### Conversion Time

You can calculate the needed time for each conversion $$(T_{CONV})$$ with this formula:

$$T_{CONV} = T_{SMPL} + T_{SAR}$$

* $$T_{SMPL}$$: Configured sampling time
* $$T_{SAR}$$: Successive approximation time depending on data resolution

In SensEdu, $$T_{SMPL}$$ is configured to $$2.5$$ ADC clock cycles, which correpsonds to bits `SMP[2:0] = 0b001` in the **ADC_SMPR1** and **ADC_SMPR2** registers.

ADC conversions are fixed to 16-bit resolution, so $$T_{SAR}$$ is constant and equals to $$8.5$$ ADC clock cycles.

The ADC clock is routed from the PLL2 clock and set to $$25\text{MHz}$$ for each individual ADC, which gives us:

$$T_{CONV} = (2.5 \text{ cycles} + 8.5 \text{ cycles}) * \frac{1}{f_{\text{adc_ker_ck}}} = 11 \text{ cycles} * \frac{1}{25\text{MHz}} = 440\text{ns}$$

SensEdu is configured to x2 oversampling (basically, averaging), so we require around $$880\text{ns}$$ per one ADC conversion, which theoretically gives us a maximum $$1136\text{kS/sec}$$ sampling rate. Based on the practical tests of the ADC sampling rate, the theoretical maximum of the sampling rate can be achieved with a negligible error that is the result of various additional delays. Therefore, the practical limit of the ADC sampling rate is set to $$1000\text{kS/sec}$$ which corresponds to a sampling frequency of $$1\text{MHz}$$. Any attempt to increase this rate further results in a decrease in the actual sampling rate of the module.

### Clock Configuration

To configure the ADC clock, it is first necessary to configure the **PLL** (Phase-Locked Loop). The PLL contains frequency multipliers and dividers that enable the generation of different frequencies, which are multiples of the input frequency.

The source frequency for the PLL is the HSE (High Speed External Oscillator), which has a frequency of 16MHz.
{: .fw-500}

The clock is first divided by DIVM2, which is set to 4, resulting in a 4MHz PLL2 input frequency ($$\text{ref2_ck}$$). Additionally, the PLL2RGE field in the PLLCFGR register must be configured according to the selected range for $$\text{ref2_ck}$$. Since we use 4MHz, it is set to the 4:8MHz range.

The clock is then multiplied by DIVN2, which is set to 75, resulting in a **VCO** (Voltage-Controlled Oscillator) frequency of 300MHz. The frequency was selected to fit within the chosen VCO range in the PLL2VCOSEL field of the PLLCFGR register, which is set to the narrow range of 150:420MHz.

Finally, the VCO frequency is divided by DIVP2, which is set to 6, resulting in a 50MHz frequency for the shared ADC bus.

The ADC clock is selected to be independent and asynchronous with the AHB clock, named $$\text{adc_ker_ck_input}$$ and derived from PLL2. The clock then passes through a settable prescaler CKMODE in the ADCx_CCR register, which is set to 1 (no clock division). Then, it passes through a fixed /2 prescaler, resulting in a 25MHz frequency ($$F_{\text{adc_ker_ck}}$$) for each individual ADC. This frequency must comply with the maximum ADC clock frequency specified in Table 99 of the [STM32H747 Datasheet].

### Cache Coherence

When using the ADC with DMA, you must account for data cache (D‑Cache) coherence. The DMA controller writes samples directly to memory, bypassing the CPU and therefore not updating the cache. If CPU then reads the buffer from cache, it may read outdated samples stored in cache instead of the actual data in memory, as it is not aware of DMA transfers.

To ensure the CPU reads fresh data, **invalidate the D-Cache lines** that cover the DMA destination buffer. Use the CMSIS function `SCB_InvalidateDCache_by_Addr(mem_addr, mem_size)`, where:
* `mem_addr`: the start address of the ADC buffer (aligned to a cache-line boundary)
* `mem_size`: the length **in bytes**

Invalidation operates on whole cache lines. If the buffer is not aligned or its size is not a multiple of the cache-line size, invalidation may affect cache lines that also contain unrelated variables, which can degrade performance.

To avoid that, align the ADC buffer to the cache-line size and choose a buffer length that is a cache-line multiple. On STM32H747, the D-Cache line size is 32 bytes and is available as the macro `__SCB_DCACHE_LINE_SIZE`. For a `uint16_t` buffer, the element count should be a multiple of 16. A properly aligned manual declaration looks like this:

```c
const uint16_t memory4adc_size = 128; // multiple of __SCB_DCACHE_LINE_SIZE/sizeof(uint16_t)
__attribute__((aligned(__SCB_DCACHE_LINE_SIZE))) uint16_t memory4adc[memory4adc_size];
```

The SensEdu library automates both proper buffer declaration and cache invalidation. Use the following procedure:
* Declare the buffer with `SENSEDU_ADC_BUFFER(name, user_size)` where:
  * `name`: the variable name to access the buffer later in code
  * `user_size`: the number of required `uint16_t` elements
* Start the ADC with `SensEdu_ADC_Start(ADC_TypeDef* ADC)` after initialization

The library:
- Ensures the buffer is aligned to `__SCB_DCACHE_LINE_SIZE`
- Rounds the actual allocation as needed to satisfy cache-line requirements
- Performs the required cache invalidation automatically inside `SensEdu_ADC_Start(ADC_TypeDef* ADC)` before starting DMA transfers

```c
const uint16_t buf_size = 50;
uint8_t pins[1] = {A0};
SENSEDU_ADC_BUFFER(buf, buf_size);
SensEdu_ADC_Settings adc_settings = {
    .adc = ADC1,
    .pins = pins,
    .pin_num = 1,
    .conv_mode = SENSEDU_ADC_MODE_CONT,
    .sampling_freq = 0,
    .dma_mode = SENSEDU_ADC_DMA_CONNECT,
    .mem_address = (uint16_t*)buf,
    .mem_size = buf_size
};

void setup() {
    SensEdu_ADC_Init(&adc_settings);
    SensEdu_ADC_Enable(ADC1);
    SensEdu_ADC_Start(ADC1);
}

void loop() {
    if (SensEdu_ADC_GetTransferStatus(ADC1)) {
        Serial.println("------");
        for (uint16_t i = 0; i < buf_size; i++) {
            Serial.println(buf[i]);
        }
        SensEdu_ADC_ClearTransferStatus(ADC1);
        SensEdu_ADC_Start(ADC1);
    }
}
```

{: .NOTE}
The `SENSEDU_ADC_BUFFER` macro accepts **any** user-defined size in `uint16_t` elements. The library allocates a slightly larger buffer internally to meet cache‑line requirements. Continue to use the requested element count (`user_size`) ignoring the internally padded capacity.

{: .WARNING}
Some legacy projects manually declare DMA buffers using the `__attribute__((aligned(...)))`. While this can work, it is easy to get alignment or sizing wrong, which can lead to unnecessary cache invalidation or other unexpected behavior. Whenever you use the ADC in DMA mode, prefer `SENSEDU_ADC_BUFFER`.
